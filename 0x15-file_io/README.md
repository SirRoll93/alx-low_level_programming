[0. Tread lightly, she is near](https://github.com/SirRoll93/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x15-file_io/0-read_textfile.c) | Write a function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.\`Prototype: ssize_t read_textfile(const char *filename, size_t letters);`\where `letters` is the number of letters it should read and print returns the actual number of letters it could read and print if the file can not be opened or read,\`return 0 if filename is NULL`\`return 0 if write fails or does not write the expected amount of bytes,`\`return 0`\
[1. Under the snow](https://github.com/SirRoll93/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x15-file_io/1-create_file.c) | Create a function that creates a file.\ `Prototype: int create_file(const char *filename, char *text_content);`\ where `filename` is the name of the file to create and text_content is a `NULL` terminated string to write to the file\ `Returns: 1 on success,`\ `-1 on failure` (file can not be created, file can not be written, write “fails”, etc…)\ The created file must have those permissions: `rw-------.`\ If the file already exists, do not change the permissions.\ if the file already exists, truncate it if filename is NULL return -1\ if text_content is NULL create an empty file\
[2. Speak gently, she can hear](https://github.com/SirRoll93/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x15-file_io/2-append_text_to_file.c) | Write a function that appends a text at the end of a file.\`Prototype: int append_text_to_file(const char *filename, char *text_content);`\where `filename` is the name of the file and text_content is the NULL terminated string to add at the end of the file\`Return: 1 on success` and `-1` on failure\Do not create the file if it does not exist\If filename is NULL return -1 If text_content is NULL, do not add anything to the file.\Return 1 if the file exists and -1 if the file does not exist or if you do not have the required permissions to write the file\
[3. cp](https://github.com/SirRoll93/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x15-file_io/3-cp.c) | Write a program that copies the content of a file to another file.\Usage: cp file_from file_to\if the number of argument is not the correct one, exit with code 97 and print Usage: cp file_from file_to, followed by a new line, on the POSIX standard error\if file_to already exists, truncate it\if file_from does not exist, or if you can not read it, exit with code 98 and print Error: Can't read from file `NAME_OF_THE_FILE,` followed by a new line, on the `POSIX` standard error\where `NAME_OF_THE_FILE` is the first argument passed to your program\if you can not create or if write to file_to fails, exit with code 99 and print Error: Can't write to `NAME_OF_THE_FILE,` followed by a new line, on the `POSIX` standard error\where `NAME_OF_THE_FILE` is the second argument passed to your program\if you can not close a file descriptor , exit with code 100 and print Error: Can't close `fd FD_VALUE`, followed by a new line, on the POSIX standard error\where `FD_VALUE` is the value of the file descriptor\Permissions of the created file: rw-rw-r--. If the file already exists, do not change the permissions\You must read 1,024 bytes at a time from the file_from to make less system calls. Use a buffer\You are allowed to use dprintf.
[4. elf](https://github.com/SirRoll93/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x15-file_io/100-elf_header.c) | Write a program that displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of an ELF file.\Usage: elf_header elf_filename\Displayed information: (no less, no more, do not include trailing whitespace)\Magic\Class\Data\Version\OS/ABI\ABI Version\Type\Entry point address\Format: the same as readelf -h (version 2.26.1)\If the file is not an ELF file, or on error, exit with status code 98 and display a comprehensive error message to stderr\You are allowed to use lseek once\You are allowed to use read a maximum of 2 times at runtime\You are allowed to have as many functions as you want in your source file\You are allowed to use printf.
